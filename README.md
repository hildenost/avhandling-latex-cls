# avhandling-latex-cls
Latex class file for thesis writing

## Quick start
The only files needed for thesis editing is:
* avhandling.cls (main class file)
* nature.* (provides the nature biber style)
and if needing the physics package:
* physics.sty
* logreq.* (required by physics.sty)

Easy installation is just copying the above-mentioned files to your project folder.
The class can also be uploaded to ShareLatex/OverLeaf.

## Demo
The [main.pdf](../blob/master/main.pdf) file shows how [main.tex](../blob/master/main.tex) looks like when compiled.

Good luck with the thesis writing!
